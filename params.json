{"name":"ARChromeActivity","tagline":"A UIActivity subclass that opens URLs in Google Chrome","body":"# ARChromeActivity\r\n\r\n`ARChromeActivity` is a `UIActivity` subclass that provides an \"Open in Chrome\" action to a `UIActivityViewController`.\r\n\r\nForked by Alex RupÃ©rez who adds i18n multilingual support and other internal improvements. \r\n\r\n![ARChromeActivity screenshot](https://raw.github.com/alexruperez/ARChromeActivity/master/screenshot.png \"ARChromeActivity screenshot\")\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- As `UIActivity` is iOS 6 only, so is the subclass.\r\n- This project uses ARC. If you want to use it in a non ARC project, you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to ARChromeActivity.m in Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd the `ARChromeActivity` subfolder to your project. There are no required libraries other than `UIKit`.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n*(See example Xcode project)*\r\n\r\nSimply `alloc`/`init` an instance of `ARChromeActivity` and pass that object into the applicationActivities array when creating a `UIActivityViewController`.\r\n\r\n```objectivec\r\nNSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://github.com/alexruperez\"];\r\nARChromeActivity *activity = [[ARChromeActivity alloc] init];\r\nUIActivityViewController *activityViewController = [[UIActivityViewController alloc] initWithActivityItems:@[URL] applicationActivities:@[activity]];\r\n[self presentViewController:activityViewController animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that you can include the activity in any UIActivityViewController and it will only be shown to the user if there is a URL in the activity items.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended usage with [RDActivityViewController](https://github.com/rdougan/RDActivityViewController).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
